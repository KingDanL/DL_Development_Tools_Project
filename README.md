# Random Events Simulation Tool

This project is a tool to simulate random events, specifically focusing on analyzing:
1. The amount of 4WD cars per year per model. 
2. The correlation between price and model year.

It uses Python along with the Pandas, Plotly Express, and Streamlit libraries to implement the analysis and visualization.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Plotly Express: For creating interactive data visualizations.
- Streamlit: For building and deploying the web application.
